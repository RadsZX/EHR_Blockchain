# Sample Hardhat Project

This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case. It comes with a sample contract, a test for that contract, and a script that deploys that contract.

Try running some of the following tasks:

npx hardhat test
npx hardhat node
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js

node server.js
curl -X POST -F "file=@your\img\path" http://localhost:5000/upload

```
